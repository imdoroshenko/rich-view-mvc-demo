rich-view-mvc-demo
==================

Demo of MVC application based on RV framework

RV (Rich View) is my pet project, it is small framework that allows to build small and handy view components with strict MVC structure. Also, It is a testing ground for my Dependency Injection library https://github.com/imdoroshenko/registerjs

Unfortunately, work is still in progress.
